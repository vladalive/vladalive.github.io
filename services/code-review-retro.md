# Full retrospective code review

## Who needs it?

You need it if you are:

1\. **CEO, Startup Founder or Project Manager**,
who want to identify the quality of written code by developers
or to audit efforts and results of your development team

2\. **CTO or Development Team Lead**, who want:

* to reduce technical debt
* to make code easier to read, maintain and extend
* to adopt industry best practices
* to find weaknesses in code architecture
* to develop the common coding approach for the whole team

3\. **Software Engineer** who want to write code better

## My ultimate goals of doing full retrospective code review

* to identify the problems preventing from good progress
* to propose solutions for improvement
* to get the development team on the same page
* to reduce the cost of change requests in the future

## These types of issues will be exposed during the code review

* code readability
* code style consistency
* development best practices
* files and modules structure
* code internal dependencies
* updated external dependencies
* building, compilation, and deployment
* security vulnerability
